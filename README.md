# Project Hero - Team H

Project Hero is a project that aims to connect freelancers with people who require help with tasks. It serves as a hub of communication between task booker and accepter, facilitating the transaction and event itself.


#  Setting up

  - After downloading the source code, import the SQL script(hero_db.sql) located in the database_scripts folder
  - Ensure the ConnectionManager.php located in the Model folder is properly configured to your settings
  - Access the webpage via homepage.php (This functions as an index.html page)
  - Sign-up for an account via the log-in button at the top right hand corner of the navigation bar

# Functionality
  - Account Creation and Logging in
  - Posting of task/gig by user
  - View list of bookings and accept booking made by other users
  - Message each other via a chat function
  - View status of the gig/task with an interactive Map showing the distance and duration of the booker and accepter
  - Mark the gig/task as completed when desired
  - Profile page which allows the user to edit their profile details including name and display picture
  - Viewing of personal earnings which displays the total amount the user has earned using our website in a chart format using chart.js
  - History page where the user can view all the past tasks/gigs that they have created
  - Top Heroes page which shows a leaderboard of users who have accepted tasks and orders them by total tasks completed
